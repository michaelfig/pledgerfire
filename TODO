* Use OT to enable collaborative editing of notes.

* Use Firebase Functions to record time and GPS stamps when entries are logged.

* Within a given tracker, we log the start and stop times and all the
add/remove times of the categories in that entry.  For reports, "Hard"
categories use the add/remove times, "Soft" categories use the final
state of the tracker.

* When we start a tracker, we add all the non-conflicting categories
of the trackers we toggle.
